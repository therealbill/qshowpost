QShowPost

This is a tool for viewing and watching the stats on one or more postfix queues. 
It supports multiple instances of Postfix per box via the config file

Build from the src directory.
=============================
In src/ do the following:
1. qmake
2. make

Now you should have your binary ready. You can run it with a
--config=/path/to/your/config or put the config in /etc/ and it will read it
from there. It will require root pemrissions to read the spool directories.

To install, copy it where you want, install the configfile, and if desired the manpages and docs.
